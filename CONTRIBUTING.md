# Contributing to yolkbot!

I welcome contributions from the community to help improve yolkbot! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the developer QoL, your contributions are valuable. Contributing should be considered a three step process:

1. Consult me. I am the final "yes"-er or "no"-er on all contributions. Please open an issue or contact me directly to discuss your proposed changes before you start working on them. I hate to see lots of work go to waste because your vision is different from mine.
2. Fork the repository and make your changes in a feature branch. I won't tell you how to write, eslint will! Run `bun lint --fix` to automatically fix most issues. You are responsible for fixing the other issues as well as testing your code.
3. Open a pull request against the default branch. Please include a description of your changes and why you think they should be merged. I will review your code and provide feedback or request changes as necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> Please don't use AI to "vibe" an entire PR. AI can be a useful tool for tabcompletions and boilerplating, but having AI write most of a PR is not acceptable. It is faster me for me to write the code myself than to review and fix AI-generated code.

Thank you for the support! I look forward to working with you to make yolkbot even cooler.
